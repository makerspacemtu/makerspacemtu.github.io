bio: Hi, I’m a certified crazy person named Gi. I’m a second year Mechanical Engineering Student with a love for leadership, making the world a better place, and building community. I also love to 3D print, make things out of wood, and sew, just to name a few things. When I’m not in the Makerspace, you can find me working for Sound and Lighting Services or at the Rozsa Center, or in my hall, the Visual Performing Arts Community, in West Wads.
